# Blender GazeboSim Toolkit

The Blender GazeboSim Toolkit is a project aimed at facilitating the development of .sdf worlds and models in Blender for use in GazeboSim, the robotics simulator.

> For now we only support GazeboSim7 (Gazebo Garden)

## Overview

This toolkit provides a set of tools, scripts, and guidelines to streamline the process of creating and exporting .sdf files from Blender. By leveraging the power and flexibility of Blender's 3D modeling capabilities, developers can design intricate worlds and models, and seamlessly integrate them into GazeboSim for realistic robotic simulations.

## Features

- Intuitive Blender integration: The toolkit offers a seamless integration with Blender, allowing developers to leverage its powerful 3D modeling capabilities.
- Export to .sdf format: The toolkit provides a straightforward export process to convert Blender models and worlds into the .sdf format, compatible with GazeboSim.
- Customizable parameters: Developers have the flexibility to customize various parameters, such as physics properties, lighting, and materials, to achieve the desired simulation environment.
- Documentation and examples: The toolkit includes comprehensive documentation and a collection of examples to guide developers through the process of creating .sdf worlds and models.
